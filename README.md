# N-Puzzle Solver

## Project Overview
This project is an **N-Puzzle Solver** implemented in Python using **Pygame** for visualization.  
The program allows the user to solve the classic sliding puzzle problem (e.g., 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle) using different search algorithms and heuristics.  
It also provides an animated visualization of the solution path.

## Features
- Supports different puzzle sizes (3×3, 4×4, 5×5).
- Multiple search algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Best-First Search
  - A* Search
- Heuristics:
  - Manhattan Distance
  - Misplaced Tiles
- Step-by-step animation of the solution.
- Simple and interactive GUI built with **Pygame**.
