# N-Puzzle Solver

## Project Overview
This project is an **N-Puzzle Solver** implemented in Python using **Pygame** for visualization.  
The program allows the user to solve the classic sliding puzzle problem (e.g., 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle) using different search algorithms and heuristics.  
It also provides an animated visualization of the solution path.
